# C++ Practical
**Question 1:** write a program to compute the sum of the first term of the following series:  S= 1-1/(2^2)+1/(3^3)=.....1/(n^n) where ^ is exponentiation. the number of terms n is to be taken from user through command line if command line argument is not found then prompt the user to enter the value of n.
